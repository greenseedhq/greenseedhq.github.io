        <p>With a lot less space than he had before, he was looking for new ways to fulfill his love of gardening. He was in a very different climate, and did not know what could be grown, nor did he know anyone else around him who shared his passion.</p>

     <h2 class="story">He soon met Naomi, who was using her rooftop as a garden. </h2>

    <h2>The two friends bonded over their love of gardening and they shared their experiences and frustrations with each other over a cup of green tea.</h2> <p>They got in contact with other gardeners and realized they were not alone in their frustrations. After a lot of talking, musing, and brain racking, Greenseed was born. This would be a single online gardening platform that would encourage and educate people, whilst connecting local people and strengthening communities.</p>
